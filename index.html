                <h2>CHAPTER 1</h2>
                <h3>The Cloak</h3>

                <p> There was once a young huntsman who went into the forest to lie in
                wait. He had a fresh and joyous heart, and as he was going thither,
                whistling upon a leaf, an ugly old crone came up, who spoke to him
                and said, "Good-day, dear huntsman, truly you are merry and
                contented, but I am suffering from hunger and thirst, do give me an
                alms." The huntsman took pity on the poor old creature, felt in his
                pocket, and gave her what he could afford.</p>

                <p> He was then about to go further, but the old woman stopped him and
                    said, "Listen, dear huntsman, to what I tell you.  I will make you a
                    present in return for your good heart.  Go on your way now, but in a
                    little while you will come to a tree, whereon nine birds are sitting
                    which have a cloak in their claws, and are fighting for it, take your
                    gun and shoot into the midst of them.  They will let the cloak fall
                    down to you, but one of the birds will be hurt, and will drop down
                    dead.  Carry away the cloak, it is a wishing-cloak.  When you throw
                    it over your shoulders, you only have to wish to be in a certain
                    place, and you will be there in the twinkling of an eye.  Take out
                    the heart of the dead bird and swallow it whole, and every morning
                    early, when you get up, you will find a gold piece under your
                    pillow." The huntsman thanked the wise woman, and thought to himself,
                    "Those are fine things that she has promised me, if all does but come
                    true." And verily when he had walked about a hundred paces, he heard
                    in the branches above him such a screaming and twittering that he
                    looked up and saw there a swarm of birds who were tearing a piece of
                    cloth about with their beaks and claws, and tugging and fighting as
                    if each wanted to have it all to himself.  </p>

                <blockquote>
                     <em>
                    "Well," said the huntsman,
                    "this is amazing, it has really come to pass just as the old crone
                    foretold," and he took the gun from his shoulder, aimed and fired
                    right into the midst of them, so that the feathers flew about. </em>
                </blockquote>
        
                 <p> The birds instantly took to flight with loud outcries, but one dropped
                    down dead, and the cloak fell at the same time.  Then the huntsman
                    did as the old woman had directed him, cut open the bird, sought the
                    heart, swallowed it down, and took the cloak home with him.
